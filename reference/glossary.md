# Glossary

Plain-language definition first, then how practitioners use the term. Alphabetical. Modules append as they're built.

**Break-glass account** — An emergency admin identity kept locked away, used only when normal admin access fails, and alerted on whenever it signs in. (Module 00)

**Budget (cloud billing)** — A spending threshold that sends alerts as actual or forecasted cost crosses percentages you set. On all three clouds, budgets notify; they don't stop resources. (Module 00)

**Cloud shell** — A free, temporary Linux environment in the browser, pre-authenticated and preloaded with the provider's CLI: Google Cloud Shell, AWS CloudShell, Azure Cloud Shell. Keeps credentials off your laptop. (Module 00)

**Control plane / data plane** — The control plane is where you *manage* resources (create a VM, change a policy) — almost always API calls. The data plane is where the resource *does its work* (traffic through a VM, reads from a bucket). Logging and permissions often differ between the two.

**Free trial vs free tier** — A free trial is time-limited credit you can spend broadly (Google $300/90 days; AWS up to $200 on a 6-month free plan; Azure $200/30 days, as of 2026). A free tier is specific services with monthly limits that stay free. (Module 00)

**IaaS / PaaS / SaaS** — How much of the stack the provider runs for you. IaaS: they run hardware and virtualization; you run the OS up. PaaS: they also run the OS and runtime; you bring code and data. SaaS: they run the whole application; you manage users and data. (Module 01)

**IAM Identity Center (AWS)** — AWS's service for human sign-in to AWS accounts and apps, using permission sets instead of long-lived IAM users. Its organization instance runs in an AWS Organizations management account. (Module 00)

**Least privilege** — Give each identity only the permissions it needs, for only as long as it needs them. The cloud version of need-to-know.

**NIST SP 800-145** — The U.S. government's definition of cloud computing: five essential characteristics (on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service), three service models, four deployment models. Citing it signals fluency with government customers. (Module 01)

**Permission set (AWS)** — A reusable bundle of permissions in IAM Identity Center that you assign to a user or group for a specific AWS account. (Module 00)

**Phishing-resistant MFA** — A second factor cryptographically bound to the real website (passkeys, FIDO2 security keys), so a fake login page can't capture and replay it. SMS codes and push approvals are not phishing-resistant. (Module 00)

**Region / zone** — A region is a geographic area containing several isolated data-center groups called zones (AWS: Availability Zones). Spreading across zones protects against a single facility failing; spreading across regions protects against a regional outage. (Module 02)

**Root user (AWS)** — The identity created with an AWS account, with unrestricted access including billing and account closure. AWS requires MFA on it; best practice is no access keys and rare use. Google Cloud has no direct equivalent. (Module 00)

**Shared responsibility model** — The provider secures the cloud itself (facilities, hardware, hypervisor); the customer secures what they put in it. Identity, access control, firewall rules, network configuration, and data are always the customer's job. (Module 01)

**VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** — A private, software-defined network inside a cloud provider, where you define IP ranges, subnets, routes, and firewall rules. Closest homelab analogy: your OPNsense-managed VLANs — but defined entirely by API. (Module 10)
